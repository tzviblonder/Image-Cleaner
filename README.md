# Image Cleaner
## An autoencoder that cleans noisy images

#### Even in a world filled with cameras, we don't always have the photos we'd like, and even when we do, they don't always come out the way they should. Poor lighting, camera quality, movement, and a myriad of factors can lead to our pictures being distorted. This program fixes that by taking images that are blurry or "noisy" (think staticky) and cleans them up. It does so using an encoder-decoder architecture that first encodes images in smaller vector spaces, and then uses a decoder to reconstruct the images.
